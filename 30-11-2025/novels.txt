Chapter 1: Ember Valley
The sun crawled over the edge of Ember Valley, spilling gold across the cracked soil.
Farmers moved slowly through the morning dust, carrying tools older than their memories.
Children chased each other near the well, shouting about imaginary monsters.

Rumors had circulated for weeks: strange lights at the northern cliffs.
Most adults dismissed them as the wind playing tricks, yet everyone felt the tension.

Lena woke before dawn. She tightened her boots, grabbed her satchel,
and whispered to herself, "Today I find out what's really up there."

She crossed the wheat fields, stepping carefully between the rows.
A lone raven followed her, circling lazily above.

Chapter 2: The Path
The northern trail was colder. Shadows lingered.
Every few steps, Lena found curious markings—circles, spirals, scratches too even to be natural.

She knelt before one pattern etched into a stone:
three rings, nested tightly, like ripples frozen in rock.

A soft hum vibrated through her boots.

She spun around, half expecting someone behind her.
Only the raven perched nearby, tilting its head.

Chapter 3: Cliffs
The cliffs rose like giant broken teeth.
Wind whistled through the gaps, carrying the scent of metal and old rain.

Lena climbed slowly, gripping ledges worn smooth by centuries.

Halfway up, she noticed more markings:
arrows pointing inward, toward a narrow slit in the cliff face.

A cave.

Chapter 4: The Cave
The interior was dry and warm.
A faint violet glow pulsed from deeper within.

Lena touched the cave wall—it was warm,
like something living beneath the rock.

She walked further until she reached a chamber shaped like a dome.
In the center stood a stone pedestal, cracked but still intact.

Upon it rested an orb, large as an apple, glowing softly.

Chapter 5: Contact
When Lena lifted the orb, every marking in the cave flickered bright.
The hum she felt earlier surged through her entire body.

Images burst behind her eyes:
mountains crumbling,
rivers boiling,
a tower of black stone rising from the valley floor.

Then calm.

The orb dimmed and turned silent.

Chapter 6: Return
Lena staggered out into daylight.
The raven took off, startled.

She could see the entire valley from here—quiet, peaceful,
completely unaware of what slept beneath.

She wrapped the orb in cloth
and whispered to herself,
"I need to find the Elders."

Chapter 7: Awakening
By the time she reached the village, the sky had turned orange.
Children were being called indoors, animals tied for the night.

But Lena froze when she saw the well.

The water was glowing faint violet.

A single ripple formed on its surface,
slow, deliberate,
as if something below had finally opened an eye.
