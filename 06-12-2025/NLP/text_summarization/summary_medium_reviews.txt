I’ve been using the MacBook Pro M4 Max for two weeks now and I’m completely blown away. The performance is insane — I can compile large codebases in seconds and edit 8K video without any lag. Battery life easily lasts 20+ hours with heavy development work. The mini-LED display is gorgeous and the new haptic keyboard feels perfect. Yes, it’s expensive, but if you’re a professional developer or content creator, this is hands-down the best laptop ever made.

The only minor complaints are the lack of ports (still only three Thunderbolt and HDMI) and the notch on the screen, but I barely notice it anymore. Highly recommended!
