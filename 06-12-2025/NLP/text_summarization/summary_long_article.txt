The World Health Organization declared on Wednesday that the ongoing mpox outbreak in Africa constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. This is only the second time in three years that WHO has issued its highest level of alert.

Cases of the new clade Ib variant have surged in the Democratic Republic of Congo and have now been detected in twelve African countries. Unlike the 2022 outbreak that was largely confined to men who have sex with men, the current strain is spreading primarily through household contacts and sexual transmission in heterosexual networks.

Health experts warn that without urgent intervention, the virus could spread further both within Africa and globally. The Africa CDC estimates that the continent needs at least 10 million doses of vaccine, but only about 200,000 are currently available.

Several countries including Japan, Spain and Germany have begun donating doses from their national stockpiles. The United States has pledged $500 million in aid and promised to deliver 1 million doses by early 2025.
