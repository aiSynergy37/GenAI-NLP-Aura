The battery life on this laptop is incredible, lasts all day even with heavy coding.
Terrible customer service. Waited 2 hours on hold and they couldn't solve my issue.
These wireless earbuds have amazing sound quality and noise cancellation.
The shoes arrived damaged and the return process was a nightmare.
Fast shipping! Ordered on Monday, arrived Wednesday morning.
The material feels cheap and the stitching came apart after one week.
Best coffee machine I've ever owned. Makes perfect espresso every time.
The app keeps crashing on my iPhone 15. Please fix this in the next update.
Great value for money. This 4K TV has brilliant colors and HDR.
The hotel room was clean but the Wi-Fi was painfully slow.
Food was delicious but the portions were too small for the price.
Driver was friendly and arrived 5 minutes early. 5 stars!
