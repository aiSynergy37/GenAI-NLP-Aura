Global economic activity expanded steadily in 2025 despite rising energy prices and continued supply chain disruptions. 
According to data released by the International Monetary Fund, growth remained strongest in Southeast Asia and parts of Latin America. 
Economists attribute the resilience to increased digital adoption and large-scale infrastructure investments supported by both public and private sectors.

In the United States, consumer spending continued to rise, helped by wage growth in the technology and healthcare industries. 
However, inflation pressures remain a concern for policymakers, who have signaled a cautious approach to adjusting interest rates. 
Analysts note that the Federal Reserve is balancing the need to support economic recovery while also preventing the economy from overheating.

European markets also experienced moderate growth. 
Germany and France reported gains in manufacturing output, driven largely by expanded renewable energy programs and investments in green technologies. 
Meanwhile, Southern European countries saw tourism numbers rebound significantly, nearing pre-pandemic levels.

Despite overall optimism, risks remain. 
Geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and ongoing trade disputes could negatively impact global supply chains. 
Economists warn that any escalation could lead to increased volatility in commodity prices and reduced investor confidence.
